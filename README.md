# macOS on Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 7th Generation, Model 20R1

This is a work-in-progress attempting to boot macOS on the Lenovo X1C7.

WiFi is soldered in the X1C7 so I am attempting to run a compatible card (BCM94350ZAE) in the available WWAN m.2 slot.

Current Status:

- ✅ Booting Clover Bootloader
- ❌ Booting macOS installer
- ❌ Installed to HD
- ❌ Graphics
- ❌ Touchpad
- ❌ Trackpoint
- ❌ WiFi
- ❌ Hibernation
- ❌ HDMI output
- ❌ Bluetooth
- ❌ USB-C
- ❌ Webcam
- ❌ Audio
- ❌ iCloud (App Store, iMessage, FaceTime, etc)
- ❌ HiDPI, Handoff, Sidecar
- ❌ Fingerprint Reader
- ❌ Power Management Optimizations

# Hardware

I have replaced the hard drive with a Samsung 970 EVO NVMe SSD.
